Project 1: Bike Sale Dashboard 
Bike Sale dashboard answers the questions of:1. Which region has the highest sale of bikes?2. Does Age Range, Marital Status, Commute Distance and Income affect customer's purchase of bikes?

This is an interactive dashboard, allowing you to remove variables and compare the values to get a glance of whether the presence of a variable changes sale performance significantly.
